- 👋 Hi, I’m @W8pars and my name is William Parsons!

- 👀 I’m interested in constantly learning and improving myself as a compassionate human, traveling, food, 
languages (speak Spanish and English fluently along with a spattering of Russian, German, and French),
hiking, working out, video games, and more!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, HTML, CSS, and Git!

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on .... well anything open source for new learners to improve my skills and develop myself as a future software developer.

- 📫 How to reach me: email is best! parsons.developer@gmail.com
